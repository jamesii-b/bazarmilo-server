# Bazarmilo Logistics System 

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive logistics system designed to streamline operations and enhance efficiency. It consists of a robust web server developed in C++. The system incorporates real-time tracking features powered by OpenStreetMap (OSM), user authentication for security, and dynamic task management capabilities.

## Dependencies
- `sqlite3`
- `httplib`
- [`nlohmann/json`]("https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp")
- [`websocketpp`]("https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp.git")


## üåü Features
- **Real-time Tracking**: Utilizes OpenStreetMap for accurate and up-to-date location tracking.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access control to ensure data privacy and integrity.
- **Task Management**: Enables users to create, update, and monitor tasks in real-time.
- **Mobile Integration**: Companion Flutter mobile app for on-the-go access and management.

## üíª Technologies
- **Backend**: C++ for the web server, integrating with SQLite3 for database management.
- **Frontend**: Flutter framework for cross-platform mobile development.
- **Mapping**: Integration with OpenStreetMap for geospatial functionality.
- **Networking**: Utilizes httplib for handling HTTP requests and WebSocket communication.
